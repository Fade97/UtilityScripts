# UtilityScripts
This repository is a collection of scripts I use to simplify my life.  
Feel free to download/use/extend those scripts as needed.

## Python Scripts
### Installation
All python scripts are programmed and tested using [Python 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/).  
To install the required libraries run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the corresponding folders

For the most scripts you need to change some variables to get the script working for you. Those will be on the top of the file with a comment explaining how to change it. Should those comments be unclear to you, write me a pm.
